1,"Introduction to RAG","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating a response. This approach helps ground the model's outputs in factual information, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy. RAG combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to AI.","AI Handbook 2023"
2,"RAG Architecture","A typical RAG system consists of several components: 1) A document store or knowledge base, 2) An embedding model to convert text into vector representations, 3) A retrieval mechanism to find relevant documents, 4) A large language model to generate responses based on the retrieved context, and 5) A ranking system to prioritize the most relevant information.","System Design Journal"
3,"Vector Databases","Vector databases are specialized storage systems designed to efficiently index and search high-dimensional vector embeddings. They use algorithms like Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) to quickly find similar vectors. Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and Chroma. They are essential components in modern RAG systems for storing and retrieving document embeddings.","Database Technologies Review"
4,"Embedding Models","Embedding models convert text into numerical vector representations that capture semantic meaning. These models are trained to place semantically similar texts closer together in the vector space. Common embedding models include OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002, Google's text-embedding-gecko, and open-source alternatives like BERT and Sentence Transformers. The quality of embeddings significantly impacts RAG performance.","NLP Techniques Guide"
5,"Hybrid Search","Hybrid search combines multiple retrieval methods to improve results. It typically merges keyword-based search (like BM25) with semantic search (using embeddings). This approach helps overcome the limitations of each method: keyword search may miss semantic relationships, while embedding search might overlook exact matches. Hybrid search often uses a weighted combination of scores from both methods.","Search Systems Handbook"
6,"Chunking Strategies","Document chunking is the process of breaking documents into smaller pieces for indexing and retrieval. Effective chunking strategies consider: 1) Chunk size - balancing context preservation with specificity, 2) Overlap between chunks to avoid splitting related information, 3) Semantic boundaries to maintain coherent units of information, and 4) Metadata preservation to maintain document structure and provenance.","Content Processing Manual"
7,"Evaluation Metrics","RAG systems can be evaluated using several metrics: 1) Retrieval metrics like precision, recall, and nDCG measure the quality of retrieved documents, 2) Generation metrics like ROUGE and BLEU assess the quality of generated text, 3) Faithfulness metrics measure how well the generated text adheres to the retrieved information, and 4) End-to-end metrics evaluate the overall system performance on specific tasks.","AI Evaluation Framework"
8,"Hallucination Reduction","Hallucinations in LLMs refer to generated content that is factually incorrect or unsupported by the input context. RAG helps reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in retrieved information. Additional techniques include: 1) Explicit citation of sources, 2) Faithfulness checking of generated content against retrieved context, 3) Uncertainty expression when information is limited, and 4) Multi-step generation with verification.","LLM Best Practices"
9,"Reranking","Reranking is a post-retrieval step that improves the ordering of retrieved documents before they're used for generation. Unlike the initial retrieval, which often uses efficient but approximate methods, rerankers can use more computationally intensive models to better assess relevance. Cross-encoders, which examine query-document pairs together, are commonly used for reranking and often outperform bi-encoders used in initial retrieval.","Advanced IR Techniques"
10,"RAG Limitations","Despite its benefits, RAG has several limitations: 1) It depends on the quality and coverage of the knowledge base, 2) Retrieval may fail to find relevant information even when it exists, 3) The system may struggle with complex reasoning that requires synthesizing information across multiple documents, 4) There's a computational overhead compared to pure generation, and 5) The approach may still struggle with temporal data that quickly becomes outdated.","AI Systems Analysis"
11,"Enhanced RAG Techniques","Enhanced RAG techniques address limitations of basic RAG: 1) Query transformation reformulates user queries to improve retrieval, 2) Hypothetical document embeddings create synthetic representations of ideal documents, 3) Self-RAG incorporates reflection to evaluate and improve retrieval and generation, 4) Multi-step RAG breaks complex queries into sub-queries, and 5) Knowledge graph integration adds structured relationships between concepts.","Advanced AI Architectures"
12,"Self-Reflection in RAG","Self-reflection in RAG involves the system evaluating its own outputs and processes. This includes: 1) Assessing the relevance of retrieved documents to the query, 2) Evaluating the faithfulness of generated answers to the retrieved context, 3) Identifying potential hallucinations or contradictions, and 4) Taking corrective actions like re-retrieval or answer refinement. This meta-cognitive capability significantly improves system reliability.","Cognitive AI Systems"
13,"Query Reformulation","Query reformulation is the process of modifying the original user query to improve retrieval results. Techniques include: 1) Query expansion to add related terms, 2) Query specification to add details, 3) Query decomposition to break complex queries into simpler sub-queries, and 4) Hypothetical queries that anticipate the information need. LLMs can be used to automatically reformulate queries based on initial retrieval results.","Search Optimization Guide"
14,"Multi-Modal RAG","Multi-modal RAG extends the RAG paradigm beyond text to include other data types like images, audio, and video. This requires specialized embedding models that can represent different modalities in a shared vector space. Applications include answering questions about images, retrieving relevant video clips based on descriptions, and generating text that references visual content.","Multi-Modal AI Systems"
15,"RAG for Code","RAG can be applied to programming tasks by retrieving relevant code snippets, documentation, or examples. This helps developers by providing context-specific coding assistance. Code-specific RAG systems use specialized embedding models trained on code repositories and may incorporate structural information about code like abstract syntax trees. They can assist with code completion, bug fixing, and documentation generation.","Software Development AI"
