3,"Weather Patterns and Climate","Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions like temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, and cloudiness in a specific place and time. Climate, on the other hand, describes the long-term patterns of weather in a particular region, typically averaged over 30 years or more. Climate is influenced by factors including latitude, elevation, proximity to oceans, and atmospheric circulation patterns. Climate change refers to significant changes in these long-term patterns, primarily due to human activities increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.","weather"
4,"Understanding Weather Forecasts","Weather forecasts are predictions of future weather conditions based on current atmospheric data and computer models. Modern forecasting uses numerical weather prediction (NWP) models that simulate atmospheric physics on supercomputers. Short-term forecasts (1-3 days) are generally quite accurate, while accuracy decreases for longer-term forecasts. Forecasts typically include temperature, precipitation probability, wind speed and direction, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Weather apps and services obtain their data from national meteorological agencies like NOAA in the U.S. or from private weather companies.","weather"
5,"Introduction to Web Search","Web search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo use complex algorithms to find, index, and rank web pages. The search process involves crawling (discovering web pages), indexing (storing and organizing content), and ranking (determining which pages best answer a query). Search engines consider factors like keyword relevance, page authority, user location, and search history when ranking results. Modern search engines also use natural language processing to understand the intent behind queries rather than just matching keywords.","technology"
