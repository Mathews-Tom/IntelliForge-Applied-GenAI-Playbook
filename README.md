## üìä Applications

### [InsightAgent: Data Analysis](apps/insight_agent/)

A data analysis tool that allows users to upload datasets and ask questions in natural language. The application generates SQL queries and provides comprehensive analyses of the data.

**Key Features:**

- File upload (CSV, Excel)
- Natural language querying
- SQL query generation
- Interactive data tables

### [FiscalAgent: Financial Insights](apps/fiscal_agent/)

A financial analysis tool that provides insights on stocks, financial markets, and economic trends. The application integrates real-time financial data with AI-powered analysis.

**Key Features:**

- Stock price data and visualization
- Company information and analyst recommendations
- Financial news integration
- Web search capabilities

### [ContextQuest: Hybrid Retrieval](apps/context_quest/)

A hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines keyword-based and semantic search to provide more accurate and relevant information retrieval.

**Key Features:**

- BM25 keyword-based retrieval
- Embedding-based semantic search
- Hybrid retrieval with adjustable weights
- Retrieval evaluation and relevance scoring

### [GraphQuery: Knowledge Navigator](apps/graph_query/)

A knowledge graph-based system that extracts entities and relationships from documents, builds an interactive graph, and allows natural language querying of the graph.

**Key Features:**

- PDF document processing
- Entity and relationship extraction
- 3D graph visualization
- Relevant subgraph identification

### [ReflectiveRAG: Self-Correcting Retrieval](apps/reflective_rag/)

An enhanced RAG system that incorporates self-correction and reflection to improve retrieval and answer quality.

**Key Features:**

- Self-evaluation of retrieval relevance
- Answer faithfulness checking
- Query reformulation
- Transparent reflection process

### [AdaptiveQueryRAG: Contextual Strategy Selection](apps/adaptive_query_rag/)

A RAG system that adapts its retrieval strategy based on query analysis and classification.

**Key Features:**

- Query type classification
- Dynamic retrieval strategy selection
- Strategy-specific parameter tuning
- Retrieval method weighting

### [MultiPerspectiveSynth: Synthesizing Diverse Sources](apps/multi_perspective_synth/)

A RAG system that retrieves and synthesizes information from multiple, potentially conflicting sources.

**Key Features:**

- Multi-source document handling
- Perspective identification
- Agreement and disagreement detection
- Balanced information synthesis

### [ToolAugmentedRAG: Retrieval + Live Data Integration](apps/tool_augmented_rag/)

A RAG system that combines static document retrieval with dynamic data from external tools and APIs.

**Key Features:**

- Tool use detection
- API integration (stocks, weather, web search)
- Static and dynamic data synthesis
- Context-aware tool selection

### [WebQuestRAG: Dynamic Web RAG Agent](apps/web_quest_rag/)

A RAG system that dynamically builds knowledge bases from web content using crawl4ai.

**Key Features:**

- Dynamic web crawling
- RAG-optimized content extraction
- On-the-fly knowledge base creation
- Multi-source web content synthesis
